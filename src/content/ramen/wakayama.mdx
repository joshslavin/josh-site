## Origin Story
Wakayama’s bowl leans pork–soy with a gelatin-rich body and deep shoyu salinity. It grew alongside commuter culture and affordable counter dining.

## Flavor Profile
Expect a dense, collagen-forward mouthfeel with soy-driven aroma. Toppings trend simple—green onion, chashu, menma—letting broth texture shine.

## Hayazushi: The Sidekick Ritual
A uniquely Wakayama pairing: **hayazushi**—lightly vinegared pressed mackerel sushi—commonly eaten *with* ramen. It cuts through richness, resets the palate, and turns a quick bowl into a complete meal.

## Notable Shops
- **Ide Shoten** (Wakayama) — signature pork-soy depth; queues move fast.
